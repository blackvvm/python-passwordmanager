# python-passwordmanager
hy, this is my attempt at making a passwordmanager with ui in python. I am very new at programming and i learned by myself. i know the code is very sloppy and almost unreadable. so if you have any tips or tricks to make me improve feel free to help me. 
so to use this you schould put the database in the same directory as the pythonfile. the main password to login is 'test'. to add a new password to the database click the add button and follow the steps,same to delete a password.
normally everything inside the database is encrypted and safe, if you find any flaws please let me know!!
